Put my bio info here. 
I'm  a student studying Software development through the YearUp program based in Seattle. I'm still relativley new, however i'm a hardworking, motivated, and creative student who constatnly strives to learn,develop, and inspire. I enjoy coding, and i'm excited to build my skills even further in learning how to build, and design beautiful and interactive webpages,and learning and developing ways to create the neccessary modifications needed to ensure high functionality within software. 
When I'm not studying I enjoy watching as well as playing sports, watching anime, and reading.
